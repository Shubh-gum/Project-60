      <section id="bio">
        <p>My favourite hobby is reading. I enjoy reading a book when I am free. I
    started to do it when I was four years old. The first time I did it, I felt interested. So I
    kept reading. The teachers always taught me to read the difficult words. I was happy
    when I read a story with a happy ending. I was thrilled when I read a detective story.
    I enjoy reading because I like to explore the imaginative world of my
    favourite author, J.K.Rowling who writes “ Harry Potter” . There are a lot of
    advantages of reading. Reading can make me relaxed and calm. I can also learn new
    vocabulary items. Then I can further improve my English. Moreover, it can give me
    an unlimited imagination, so I can write books in the future. I can learn the different
    cultures and customs of other countries in the world too.
     I read at least one hour every day. I read books by myself. I usually read it
    at home. I wish I could read different kinds of books because it might be very
    challenging. </p>
